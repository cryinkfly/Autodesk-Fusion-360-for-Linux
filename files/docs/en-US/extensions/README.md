# Extensions for Autodesk Fusion 360 - Linux

## Here is a list of all the extensions for Autodesk Fusion 360 that I have already tested on Linux and that also work:

### Airfoil Tools: 

Anything, or part of anything that is exposed to a moving gas or liquid can benefit from a streamlined shape. 

In particular, wings, fins, ducts, propellers and turbines can all be vastly optimized by using the optimal correct shape. 

"Optimal" is complicated; it depends on size, speed, turbulence, altitude (or depth), the properties of your medium (temperature and density) and the surface finish you use (rough or smooth). 

To further complicated things, many of those things are a range (e.g. speed, temperature, pressure, etc) and when they are, there's often one point in that range where you need to concentrate on optimizing (e.g. cruising speed at cruising altitude). 

Airfoil Tools does this optimization for you.

### Additive Assistant (FFF):

The Additive Assistant tool for  Autodesk Fusion 360 has been created for beginners that are new to the FFF (Fused Filament Fabrication) process and need guidance on DfAM (Design for Additive Manufacturing). The tool analyses a number of aspects of your designs and provides clear feedback on how to improve the manufacturability of the part. The tool analyses, highlights and provides feedback on the areas of overhang, areas that may warp, whether there is a risk of poor bed adhesion, part size and provides information on reducing the environmental impact.

### Czech localization for F360:

The Czech localization for Autodesk® Fusion 360™ is an add-in, which installs and activates the Czech user interface (UI) in Fusion 360 (Win) and keeps it updated during the frequent release updates of this CAD/CAM product.
 

The scope of the CZ localization: the user interface of modeling, sketches, surfaces, meshes, freeform shapes, sheetmetal, visualization, animations, manufacturing, 3D printing, drawings, document management, generative design. The Czech environment does not cover all assortment of Fusion 360 functions, but its contents are being continuously extended.
 

You can use this localization for all types of Fusion 360 licenses, including its free variants (Personal, Startup, and Educational).

### Helical Gear Generator:

Helical gears resemble spur gears with the teeth at an angle. They can be meshed in parallel or crossed orientations at 90 degrees or arbitrary angles and can be generated with as little as a single tooth forming a screw gear.

Gears may be specified in either the 'Normal' or the 'Radial' system or the fixed profile Sunderland standard, any of which can be generated as either Left or Right handed. Handedness in helical gears refers to the direction the teeth lean when the gear is placed flat on a table.

### RoboDK:

With the RoboDK plug-in for Autodesk Fusion 360, you can easily load 3D models created in Fusion 360 to RoboDK. This plug-in allows you to program more than 50 different robot manufacturers and 500 robots directly from Fusion 360. Robots can be easily programmed as 5-axis machines for manufacturing applications such as drilling, welding, trimming, 3D printing or robot machining.

The RoboDK Add-In for Fusion is free if you have a RoboDK License.

Once installed, the RoboDK Add-In for Fusion 360 should be visible in the Toolbar. This toolbar includes 7 commands for CAD and CAM purposes:
 
- Auto Setup: This button allows you to load any selected geometry (curves or points). You can also select surfaces to extract curve normal. The geometry will be loaded in RoboDK together with the 3D model.

- Load Part: Loads the 3D model from Fusion 360 to RoboDK. Features such as curves or points won’t be loaded.

- Load Point(s): Load all the points selected in RoboDK as a new object. All selected surfaces will be used to calculate point normals. These normals are important as they define the robot’s approach axis.

- Load Curve(s): Load all the curves selected in RoboDK as a new item. All selected surfaces will be used to calculate curve normals. These normals are important as they will define the robot’s approach axis. 

- Settings: Open the default Settings window.

- Load CAM Project: Load the machining project in RoboDK. If multiple tools are used for machining, RoboDK will automatically split the program to have one project settings for each tool. This behavior can be changed in Tools-Options-CAM.

- Generate Robot Program: Generate all programs available in the RoboDK project. 

The main difference between Auto Setup and Load Curve(s) or Load Point(s) is that Auto Setup loads the part and creates a new Curve/Point following the project. Using Load Curve(s) or Load Point(s) is faster and will just update the existing geometry features in RoboDK, keeping previously defined settings.
